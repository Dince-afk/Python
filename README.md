# Python Lessons

Here are most of the projects, programs and games I've learned or have written.

Some of them include:
- a text to speech program from the Google Cloud package
- a Blackjack game
- simple graphical games with the `turtle` package
- quiz games

Many of them are from the courses ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu and ["Python for Everybody"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) by Charles Russell Severance.
